Gracie:
Goal 1: Have at least employee login php set up. This means separate files and the php connection tested and ran through NRS projects for the time being.
Goal 2: Update the CSS for the employee login and customer contact form. which is one local css file called login. Change the format to correlate better with the website colors.
Goal 3. Make sure we have a running prototype on nrs projects public_html at the dispoable for the test runner that will be using our prototype next Wednesday.


I will check back with you guys on monday to see how much we have accomplished so far.
